# Library Management System

## Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive Library Management System to automate routine operations and streamline library management tasks such as book availability, member management, fine calculation, and more.

## Approach:
This system was built from scratch using SQL to manage key aspects of a library's daily operations. The system includes an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ER-Diagram) to represent the relationships between entities such as books, members, and transactions.

## Key Features:
Book Management: Adding, deleting, and updating book details.

Member Management: Managing member information and tracking borrowed books.

Search Functionality: Allowing users to search books by title, author, or category.

Fine Management: Calculating and paying fines for overdue books.

Borrowing Operations: Issue, renew, and return books with date tracking.

## Entity-Relationship Diagram:
The ER-Diagram defines the structure of the system, detailing the relationships between key entities such as:

Books (with multiple authors and copies)

Members (with details such as membership type, borrow history)

Transactions (including issue, renewal, and return dates)

Fines (based on overdue books)

## Outcome:
This project successfully improved the information management capabilities of library operations. It enables better decision-making by providing a structured, efficient system for tracking book availability, member activities, and fine calculations.
